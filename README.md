# DSSNNetsIntro
This is intro to Neural Nets for Data Science Society Summer School (*Thanks to Angel Marchev for giving me the opportunity to bore to death several people with some math*)

You will need Python 3.6. Install from here https://www.anaconda.com/download/

==============================================================================

Optional for convenience install Git for Windows - https://git-scm.com/download/win
 - Open your command line or Terminal application and enter the directory where you would like to copy the repository. This can be anywhere in your local file system. And type:
```
git clone https://github.com/DemirTonchev/DSSNNetsIntro.git
```

Program: 
 - Derivative. Optimising functions with one variable, generalization to higher dimension. 
 - Logistic activation function (logistic regression). Other activation functions.
 - Write own code for logistic regression and gradient descent. 
 - Train a neural network (MLP classifier) 
 - Add more neurons and vectorization in numpy. 
 - Higher level libraries for NNets - Keras.
